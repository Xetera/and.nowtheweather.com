A simple site to showcase my favorite podcast's songs and its transcripts.

Welcome to Nightvale is a podcast presented as a radio show where constant strange
events are nothing out of the ordinary for the people of Nightvale. The show is
divided into different segments like the news, traffic and the weather, where the
weather is a different song each episode.
